Before running CUDA code, run the following code to add CUDA bin to PATH

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-7.5/bin

array_size must be an int

To compile and run the parallel implementation:
1) Compile : nvcc hw1_par.cu -o hw1_par.o
2) Run : /hw1_par.o 33554432

Note: This code can run any the array sizes which are power of 2, and greater than 2^20 and less than 2^26
